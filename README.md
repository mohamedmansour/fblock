AdBlocker for Facebook

What does it do?
================

Hides all sponsored ads from Facebook. Shows the counter of hidden ads on the extension icon.

Why did I do it?
================

Facebook recently made it harder to block its overly privacy invasive Sponsored Ads (http://www.techmeme.com/160809/p7#a160809p7).
As a big proponent of privacy, I believe targeted advertising is messed up. If I goto Amazon and search for something, I come back to 
Facebook and see that advertising in my face. That annoys me. If that annoys you, then install this extension.

Instead of creating a generic AdBlock for all the websites, I decided to just focus on Facebook
to make it harder for them to block. If they make it even harder, we can make it a community driven
blocked ads in the future.
